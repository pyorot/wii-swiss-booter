# Wii Swiss Booter

Finds and boots [Swiss](https://github.com/emukidid/swiss-gc/) on a Wii in native GameCube mode using a cMIOS, and can be easily adapted to general GameCube software. It is needed because the Homebrew Channel cannot boot into GameCube mode by itself.

Original program by WiiPower (version 0.3 from 2011/01/15). Icon by Cisz. Check out the [program's thread](https://gbatemp.net/threads/wii-swiss-booter.277350/).

## Setup
Extract the latest release .7z file into the root of your portable SD card or USB stick. The folder structure should look like `A:/apps/Swiss/boot.dol` (same for `icon.png` and `meta.xml`). If so, it will appear and be startable from the Homebrew Channel.

This app requires a cMIOS, whose installer is available [here](https://www.mediafire.com/file/4utullykvbe2xlu/cMIOSWiiGator.7z/file). Run it from the Homebrew Channel as described in the previous paragraph. This in turn requires a cIOS, installed as per [here](https://wii.hacks.guide/cios).

This app also requires a copy of Swiss of course, which can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/emukidid/swiss-gc/releases). Download `swiss_r0000.7z`, where `0000` is replaced by the version you want, extract it, and navigate to the file `swiss_r0000\DOL\swiss_r0000.dol`. Rename it to `swiss.dol`, and place it on a device to go into your Wii.

## Usage
When you run Swiss Booter, it will look for `swiss.dol` and start the first copy it finds, searching in the order:
1. SD Gecko (in left GC memory card slot)
2. SD Gecko (in right GC memory card slot)
3. SD Card (in front Wii slot)
4. USB Drive (in either Wii slot)

Within each drive, it searches in the order:
1. `A:/apps/Swiss/swiss.dol`
2. `A:/apps/swiss.dol`
3. `A:/swiss.dol`

Tip: since the program doesn't ordinarily wait around for you to read where it loaded Swiss from, you can stall it yourself by holding A.

## Compilation
It is recommended to use Linux or WSL, since the build scripts are Linux commands. libogc is required; install it via [these instructions](https://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started) â€“ for the Unix-like instructions, select the `wii-dev` group.

To compile, run commands in the repository root on in a bash shell:
1. Run `./makeDolLoader.sh` to compile the DolLoader binary into /_data.
2. With the DolLoader binary in /_data, run `make` to produce the result in /_build and intermediate files in /_lib.
3. The `boot.dol` file in /_build can be placed in the meta folder for a complete homebrew channel app.
4. `_build`, `_data` and `_lib` can be deleted at any time.
