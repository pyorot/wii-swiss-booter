<short_description>Boots Swiss in GameCube mode.</short_description>
<long_description>This booter finds Swiss on your removable media and boots it as native GameCube software.

The Homebrew Channel can't boot GameCube homebrew in GameCube mode, which is why this application is required. You also need to have a cMIOS installed.

To find Swiss, this app checks, in order:
  SD Gecko (right slot), SD Gecko (left slot), Wii SD (front slot), either USB port.
On each, it checks, in order:
  "/apps/Swiss/swiss.dol", "/apps/swiss.dol", "/swiss.dol"

You can hold A to stall the app to see where it found Swiss.
